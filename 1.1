You can open the entire project in the following ways:

ls -a, which will list any hidden files and folders as well as normal files. A file or folder starting with . is hidden. 

Drag the folder into VS Code.
In the VS Code menu, you could select File, then Open Folder.
To open VS Code from the command line, type the command code . in the run-buddy directory. (The . syntax means "this directory".)


HTML

<ul> - unordered list
<li> - list item
<a> - anchor

Attributes can be used to give an HTML element a unique identity, create relationships with other elements, and provide design changes using CSS. They give functionality, meaning, and context to HTML elements.

Attributes aren't necessary for every element, but some do require them. One of those is the <a> element. If we were to omit the href attribute in the preceding examples, the links wouldn't work.

Here are some popular attributes:

The id attribute is a unique identifier for an HTML element. The value of this can only be used once per HTML document.

The class attribute is another way of identifying an HTML element, but its value is expected to be more general and can be reused across multiple HTML elements on a page.

The title attribute—not to be mistaken for the <title> element—holds a value that appears as a small pop-up (known as a tool-tip) when the cursor is pointed at an element for a period of time.
